A portfolio website so that I can build something with React.
Uses Material-UI to reduce time needed to mess around with css.
Stages of project are as follows:
1. (current) Add wanted elements
2. Sort out positioning
3. Create deired interactions (buttons etc)
4. Sort out colours etc 
5. Add more features (dark mode, etc)
